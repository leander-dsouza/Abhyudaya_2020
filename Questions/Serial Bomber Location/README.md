Provided to you is a non negative integer number num. For every number i, you need to find the number of 1’s in their binary representation. 0<=i<=num Return them as an array and prevent the bombings fast.

### Input Format

An integer num.

### Constraints

0<=num<=11111111

### Output Format

Print elements of the array having values as the number of 1's in their binary representation.
