# Navy Decryption

Your country is expecting an attack in the international waters and you therefore need to prepare the navy for it too. The naval chief has sent some vital information to you regarding the number of submarines that need to be deployed in a particular area.

However, there is a fear of the data being leaked so a matrix containing only 1s and 0s was sent to you. The output to the following question will tell you how many submarines need to be deployed.

You need to submit to the chief the number of square submatrices having all ones.

### Input Format

* The first line contains two integers m and n i.e. the number of rows and columns in the matrix respectively.

* The next m lines contains the n elements each of the matrix.

### Constraints

* 1<=arr.length<=300,

* 1<=arr[0].length<=300,

* 0<=arr[i][j]<=1

### Output Format

An integer equals to the number of square submatrices having all ones.
